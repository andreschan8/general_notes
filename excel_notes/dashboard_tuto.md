# Excel Dashboard Tutorial
We are following Kevin Stratvert's tutorial on Excel dashboards. We are also including any procedure that we find useful.
## 1. Extend formula down without having to select range with the mouse
Suppose I have a column with data, and in the next column I enter a formula and I want to extend it to the range of the first column. There are at least two ways to do this without using the mouse:

**i) Double click.** Double click the bottom right corner of the cell with the formula.

**ii) Try the following procedure:**

  _a) Enter your formula._
  
  _b) Copy it with Ctrl + C_
  
  _c) Move with the arrow keys to the reference column._
  
  _d) Press Ctrl + down arrow. This will set you just before the next blank space._
  
  _e) Move with the arrow keys to the desired column._
  
  _f) Press Ctrl + Shift + Up arrow to select thedesired range._
  
  _g) Paste your formula._
